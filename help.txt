Description
----------

Dunder scripting allows for an object oriented tree structure to be created within a command line console. Also a flexible way to store "object" classes for
describing and calculating models. 

Native Commands:
The dunderscripting has native commands. The native commands allow for tree navigation and low level  cut/copy and search functions.
Native commands can be grouped together in order to build more extensive commands. Such as multiple navigation , cut/copy, and search manipulations. 
The special native commands can also allow for use of math functions. By importing native libraries more native commands can be called upon. 

Custom Commands:
Custom commands allow for the users to build inline combinations of the native commands. The custom commands can be stored to the custom command list
the more commands in the list the more functionality the system can have. Custom commands are usually "macros" that string together multiple native commands.
